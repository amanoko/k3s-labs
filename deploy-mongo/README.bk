This Lab will step you through the concepts of creating a single MongoDB Database inside a pod on K3s.  This pod will be encapsulated inside a Kubernetes StatefulSet and the database data will be stored on a PVC (Persistent Storage Claim) utilising local k3s storage.

Next you will expose the MongoDB as a headless service (one without external IP address) so that all other pods within your namespace can assess the database via its app name with CoreDNS. You will not be able to access the database externally from the cluster.

<!--Note: if you get errors with kubectl try and use sudo kubectl.-->

To understand the uses and limitations of a StatefulSet use the below link.

[Kubernetes StateFulSets]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/

## Step 1:

###### Deploy local storage PVC in K3s

```kubectl
kubectl apply -f local-storage-pvc.yaml
```

###### Deploy local storage PVC in MicroK8s

```kubectl
kubectl apply -f microk8s-pvc.yaml

```

###### Deploy MongoDB headless service and MongoDB server

We will only be deploying one MongoDB Server within the K3s Cluster. All other students will create their table.

Follow the below commands to deploy and monitor what is happening.

###### K3s

```
kubectl  apply -f mongo-statefulset-v1.yaml
kubectl --namespace default get pods
```
###### MicroK8s

```
kubectl  apply -f mongo-statefulset-v2.yaml
kubectl --namespace default get pods
```

You should notice that the STATUS of the mongo-0 pod is creating.  To understand what is happening in more detail run the below command.

```
kubectl --namespace default describe pods <MONGO_POD_NAME>
```

You will see an output similar to below, the important information at this point is under Events.  Events will tell you step by step what is happening during the deployment of our StatefulSet.

```

Once you have the mongo pod with a STATUS of running proceed to the next step.

## Step 2:

###### Initialise the Database.

This section is to demonstrate that we have deployed a docker image and expanded it into a container which is being managed by a Kubernetes Pod.  We are now going to access the container and perform actions as if this was running on our machine.

**exec -it** will start an interactive terminal (-it) running sh command line into the pod then container.

```
kubectl --namespace default get pods
kubectl --namespace default exec -it <POD_NAME> sh
```

Once you have a sh terminal inside the mongoDB Pod log into the mongoDB Server by typing mongo

```
#mongo <ENTER>
```

Once you have logged in you should see the below output, if you do and have a **>** prompt continue to the next step.

```

Enable MongoDB's free cloud-based monitoring service, which will then receive and display
metrics about your deployment (disk utilization, CPU, operation statistics, etc).

The monitoring data will be available on a MongoDB website with a unique URL accessible to you
and anyone you share the URL with. MongoDB may use this information to make product
improvements and to suggest MongoDB products and deployment options to you.

To enable free monitoring, run the following command: db.enableFreeMonitoring()
To permanently disable this reminder, run the following command: db.disableFreeMonitoring()

```

Now you need to initialise the database server to be the primary server.

[Further Reading on Mongo Initiate Command]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/deploy-replica-set/	"Deploy Relica Sets"

```
>rs.initiate()
```

You should see a similar output if initiate is successful.

```
{
	"info2" : "no configuration specified. Using a default configuration for the set",
	"me" : "mongo-0:27017",
	"ok" : 1,
	"operationTime" : Timestamp(1579154177, 1),
	"$clusterTime" : {
		"clusterTime" : Timestamp(1579154177, 1),
		"signature" : {
			"hash" : BinData(0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA="),
			"keyId" : NumberLong(0)
		}
	}
}
rs0:OTHER>
rs0:PRIMARY>
```

Congratulations you have setup a Mongo Database Server running on Kubernetes inside the default namespace. To exit mongo and the interactive shell follow the below prompts.

```
rs0:PRIMARY> exit
#exit
```
